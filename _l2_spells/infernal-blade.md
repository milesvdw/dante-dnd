*2nd-level evocation*

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** S, M (Infernal Ruby Fragment)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You press a fragment of an infernal ruby into a weapon, releasing the last remnants of its hellish energy to grant an additional 1d6 fire damage to each hit with the weapon for as long as you can control the spell. If your concentration is broken early, the spell backfires on the wielder of the weapon, discharging the energy early.

**At Higher Levels.** +1d6 damage per 2 spell levels
