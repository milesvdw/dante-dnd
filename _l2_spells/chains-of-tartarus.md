Enchanted chains spring from the earth, wrapping around any creature caught nearby. Designate a 20 foot cube within range: creatures caught in this cube must make a strength saving throw or be restrained by the chains. Each turn, they may make a new save using their action to break free. While restrained, they take 2d6 bludgeoning damage. If the chain link used was made of fiendsteel, they take an additional 2d6 fire damage from the red-hot chains.

**At Higher Levels.** +1d6 bludgeoning damage per spell level.
